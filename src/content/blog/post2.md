Yeah, that's me! Doing (showing off) a yoga pose. üòÑ

So, why me?

**Tech + Empathy**

At Techifize.com, I provided tailored solutions to clients, especially non-tech customers, simplifying complex concepts and ensuring they felt confident and supported every step of the way. Whether it‚Äôs solving a technical issue or guiding users, trouble-shooting or even just a simple chat to help them understand, empathy is my way, which i enjoy doing.

**Hands-on + Customer-Centric**

Not just a talker, I'm a doer. I've learned there's always more than one way to solve a problem. I love tech, SaaS and i enjoy understanding different client requirements and providing the best solution to get most value out of it at any part of the implementation: has always been my goal.

I've also configured 10+ apps and even built custom tools using Javascript for clients, adapting them to their workflows.

**Yours all-in-one Ally + Problem Solver**

So, You know the business and I know tech, I know people. Let's make a deal!
