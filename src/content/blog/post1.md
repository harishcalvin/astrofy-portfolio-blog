I gave it a shot.

**From code to services**

My journey started with YouTube, freeCodeCamp and just about every online resource I could find learning how to code on my own and knocking on doors of businesses and stores, pitching my ideas & services. I was building trust, adding value and solving real-world problems. Every step was a lesson, every pitch and strategy was different, bridging the gap between tech and people, filled my days with joy and lots of work.

**One to many**

Over 1000+ outbound calls/mails, door to door and 100+ face-to-face meetings, I landed 20+ clients in a year and from nothing in my pocket to renting a little office set up in Chennai. 

**Hustle to settle**

As an all-rounder, I’ve worn many hats. While the hustle was real, what stood out the most was my love for adding value to people’s lives.

Over the past 2 years, I’ve realized that I’m at my happiest (and best) when I’m hands-on: collaborating with people/clients, solving problems, bridging tech and people always with love and purpose. This realization has shaped how I view my career. That’s why, with a background of hands-on technical experience and a passion for working with people, I’m excited for a role as a Technical  Implementation Specialist.
